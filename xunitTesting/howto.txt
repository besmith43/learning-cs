I don't think the sln is necessary, but make the source library and then the sln.  finally make the test library, and add it to the sln with the below command 

dotnet sln add .\Addition\Addition.csproj

to add the source library to the test csproj

dotnet add .\Addition.Tests\Addition.Tests.csproj reference .\Addition\Addition.csproj
